# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Git repository with your project
- Node.js and npm installed

## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Ensure your repository is public** (GitHub Pages requires this for free accounts)

## Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub**
2. **Click on "Settings" tab**
3. **Scroll down to "Pages" section**
4. **Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"**
5. **Select "gh-pages" branch**
6. **Click "Save"**

## Step 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages

From the `client` directory, run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will:
- Build your React app
- Create a `gh-pages` branch
- Push the build files to GitHub
- Deploy your site

## Step 4: Access Your Site

Your site will be available at:
`https://rashidakapadia.github.io/aeb-jamaat-portal`

## Important Notes

### Frontend Only Deployment
- This deployment only includes the React frontend
- Backend API calls will not work (you'll need a separate backend deployment)
- Remove or modify any API calls for the deployed version

### Image Paths
- Ensure all images in `/public/images/` are properly referenced
- Images should work correctly with the current setup

### Routing
- If you add React Router later, you'll need to configure it for GitHub Pages

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Ensure all import paths are correct
- Fix any ESLint warnings before deploying

### 404 Errors
- GitHub Pages may show 404 for direct URL access
- Consider adding a `404.html` page for better UX

### Images Not Loading
- Verify image paths are relative to the public folder
- Check that images are committed to the repository

## Future Updates

To update your deployed site:
1. Make your changes
2. Commit and push to main branch
3. Run `npm run deploy` from the client directory

## Alternative Deployment Options

If you need backend functionality:
- **Vercel**: Full-stack deployment
- **Netlify**: Frontend + serverless functions
- **Heroku**: Full-stack deployment
- **Railway**: Full-stack deployment
