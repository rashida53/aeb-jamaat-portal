                        The Austin Dawoodi Bohra community is growing with the city. We have been here since the '80s and currently have more than 90 families in our congregation. Our center of worship, the Anjuman-e-Burhani Markaz, is located in the fast-growing town of Pflugerville, nestled a few miles north of Austin, Texas. With the Dua of Al Hay Al Muqaddas Dai-al-Mutlaq Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin RA, we had secured and built a markaz in the year 2007. Today, with the Dua and Raza mubarak of the 53rd Dai-al-Mutlaq, His Holiness Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin TUS, we gather at the markaz for the Aza of Imam Husain AS and to remember and participate in the zikr of Panjatan AS, Aimmat Taahereen, Duaat Mutlaqeen and Hudaat Kiraam. Madrasah classes are also held at the Markaz.
